This is a simple hexdump utility written in Intel assembly
(NASM). It's copied from the book `Assembly Language Step by Step:
Programming with Linux', by Jeff Duntemann. Currently this only works
on 32-bit Linux (since that's what I have).

Use it like so:

$ hdump < file

...HEX OUTPUT GOES HERE...
